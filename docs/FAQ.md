<summary><strong>How do I access Marinara Engine from my phone or another device?</strong></summary>
<br>

If Marinara Engine is running on one device (your PC, a server, etc.) and you want to use it from a phone, tablet, or another computer on the same network:

## 1. Make sure the server is bound to all interfaces

The shell launchers (`start.sh`, `start.bat`, `start-termux.sh`) already bind to `0.0.0.0` by default. If you started manually with `pnpm start`, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in your `.env` file first. See the [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

## 2. Configure access control

Loopback (`127.0.0.1`) works without a password, ordinary LAN clients require authentication by default, and Tailscale plus Docker bridge clients are trusted by default for private installs. Set `BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` in `.env`, then restart Marinara if you want LAN users to sign in. Set `BYPASS_AUTH_TAILSCALE=false` or `BYPASS_AUTH_DOCKER=false` if you want those clients to sign in too. For privileged actions from that browser, also set `ADMIN_SECRET` and save it in **Settings -> Advanced -> Admin Access**.

You can restore the old unauthenticated LAN behavior with `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true`, but only do this on a network you fully trust. For a step-by-step walkthrough covering Basic Auth, IP Allowlist, and the private-network bypass, see [Remote Access — Setting Up Basic Auth or an IP Allowlist](REMOTE_ACCESS.md).

## 3. Find your host device's local IP address

| Platform | Command                                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `ipconfig` → look for **IPv4 Address**                                  |
| macOS    | System Settings → Wi-Fi → your network, or run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` |
| Linux    | `hostname -I` or `ip addr`                                              |
| Android  | Settings → Wi-Fi → tap your network to see the IP                       |

### 4. Open a browser on the other device

Navigate to:

```
http://<host-ip>:7860
```

For example: `http://192.168.1.42:7860`

## 5. (Optional) Install the PWA

Most mobile browsers will offer an **"Add to Home Screen"** or **"Install App"** prompt, giving you a more native app experience without browser chrome. On iPhone and iPad, see the [iOS / iPadOS PWA Guide](installation/ios-pwa.md).

### Not on the same network?

Tools like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) give each device a stable IP address on a private overlay network, so you can access Marinara Engine from anywhere without exposing it to the public internet.

### Still not connecting?

- Verify both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Confirm `HOST=0.0.0.0` and, for ordinary LAN access, Basic Auth credentials are set on the server.
- Check that no firewall is blocking the configured port (default `7860`).
- See the [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#app-not-loading-on-mobile--another-device) page for more help.

### Using Music DJ with Spotify on a LAN install?

Spotify's OAuth rules only allow `https://` or `http://127.0.0.1` redirect URIs, so the agent editor will show a `127.0.0.1` URI even when you're accessing Marinara from another device. Either put the server behind HTTPS or use the paste-back fallback in the agent editor — both flows are covered in [Music DJ Spotify login fails on a remote or LAN install](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#music-dj-spotify-login-fails-on-a-remote-or-lan-install).

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the Android APK a standalone app?</strong></summary>
<br>

Not exactly. The Android APK is a Termux bootstrap + WebView shell, not a native Android server build.

The APK opens `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` on the same Android device. If the Termux server is already running, it loads immediately. If not, the APK can help launch setup through Termux.

Fast path:

1. Install the APK from GitHub Releases.
2. Open it and tap **Install / Start Marinara**.
3. Approve Android's install prompts if Marinara needs to install Termux from F-Droid.
4. Grant **Run commands in Termux environment** if Android asks.
5. If Termux blocks external commands, paste the copied `allow-external-apps` command into Termux once.
6. Wait for Termux to install/build/start Marinara Engine, then return to the APK.

Manual fallback: follow the [Android (Termux) Installation Guide](installation/android-termux.md), run `./start-termux.sh`, then open the APK as a dedicated home-screen shell.

<summary><strong>What can Professor Mari do?</strong></summary>
<br>

Professor Mari is Marinara Engine's built-in assistant character. She can explain the app, help with setup, create characters and personas, create lorebooks, start new Conversation or Roleplay chats, navigate panels, fetch existing items so she can review or update them, and use read-only Fandom/MediaWiki lookups. She is a guide and helper, not a replacement for the docs or release notes when something is version-specific or recently changed.

Editing existing content needs more care than creating new content. Ask Mari to fetch the character, persona, lorebook, chat, or preset before editing it, and give her the specific field or behavior you want changed. Character edits keep a recoverable version snapshot, but persona edits overwrite without a snapshot, so back up personas before asking her to change one.

She cannot currently submit GitHub issues from inside the app, complete the whole Game Setup Wizard through hidden commands, or automatically ingest the latest GitHub docs into her own prompt.

See [Professor Mari](PROFESSOR_MARI.md) for the full capabilities and safety notes.

<summary><strong>Which AI providers are supported?</strong></summary>
<br>

Marinara Engine supports a wide range of LLM and image generation providers:

- **LLM:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Anthropic via Claude Pro / Max subscription (through the local Claude Agent SDK), Google Gemini, Google Vertex AI, OpenRouter, NanoGPT, Mistral, Cohere, Pollinations, Together AI, NovelAI, and any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, KoboldCpp, etc.)
- **Image generation:** Stability AI, ComfyUI, AUTOMATIC1111 / SD Web UI, Draw Things (Apple Silicon Macs — runs locally on Metal + Apple Neural Engine), and providers that support image output through their chat API

You can configure multiple connections at once and assign different providers per chat. API keys are encrypted at rest with AES-256.

<a id="why-doesnt-my-roleplay-character-remember-the-messages-from-our-connected-conversation"></a>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why doesn't my roleplay character remember the messages from our connected conversation?</strong></summary>
<br>

Connected chats (the link between a conversation and a roleplay or game) are intentionally **asymmetric** in how context flows:

**Roleplay → Conversation (automatic):** the roleplay's summary and recent messages are pulled into the conversation's context every turn, so DM characters always know what's happening in the story. Roleplay characters can also break the fourth wall back into the DM by wrapping text in `<ooc>...</ooc>` tags.

**Conversation → Roleplay (manual, via tags):** the conversation's raw messages are _not_ injected into the roleplay. To bridge content the other direction, the conversation character uses one of two OOC tags:

- `<influence>...</influence>` — one-shot steer for the _next_ roleplay turn, then consumed.
- `<note>...</note>` — durable; appears on every roleplay turn until you clear it from the chat settings drawer. Use this for facts the roleplay character should keep remembering.

This is by design — pulling raw DM messages into every roleplay turn would inflate the prompt and dilute the story. If you want something from the DM to stick in the roleplay, ask the conversation character to wrap it in a `<note>`.

<a id="how-do-i-use-one-lorebook-with-multiple-characters"></a>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I use one lorebook with multiple characters, or scope it to a specific chat?</strong></summary>
<br>

Marinara has three different ways to scope a lorebook, each at a different level. Pick whichever matches your use case:

**1. Bind a lorebook to one character or persona** (lorebook editor → `Linked Character` / `Linked Persona`).

The lorebook auto-activates in any chat that includes that character or uses that persona. Best when the lore is specifically _about_ that character (e.g., their backstory, their world). The two link types are mutually exclusive — pick one or the other, not both. Each link is single-value, so this is the right tool for one lorebook ↔ one character.

**2. Attach lorebooks per-chat via the chat settings drawer** (gear icon → **Lorebooks** section → **+ Add Lorebook**).

Multi-select. Use this when you want one lorebook active across multiple characters, or scoped to just one specific chat, or when you want several lorebooks layered together for a single chat. The lorebook's `Linked Character` / `Linked Persona` fields can be empty for this — chat attachment is independent of those links.

**3. Filter individual entries by character** (lorebook entry editor → `Character Filters`).

Inside a single shared lorebook, you can mark each entry as only firing when specific characters (or character tags) are present in the chat. Best for a "world bible" lorebook shared across many chats where some entries are character-specific.

**Common scenario — "I want this lorebook for Character A _and_ Character B":** leave the lorebook's character link empty, and attach the lorebook via the chat settings drawer in any chat that includes either character. The same lorebook can be attached to as many chats as you want.

<summary><strong>Does retrying agents rerun every agent or just one?</strong></summary>
<br>

It depends which retry button you use.

**Re-run Trackers** in the Roleplay HUD's Agents menu keeps the original broad behavior: it reruns all active tracker agents for that chat. Use this when the overall HUD state feels stale.

Individual tracker controls are narrower. If you open a specific HUD widget and rerun it from there, Marinara sends only that tracker through the retry pipeline.

Other retry controls are also scoped to what they say on the button: **Retry Failed Agents** retries the failed agents from the last generation, while Injections-tab re-runs only refresh the selected cached prompt injection for the current assistant message.

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Marinara Engine have Guided Generation / Swipes / Regen?</strong></summary>
<br>

Yes. Use `/guided <direction>` when you want to steer the AI's next reply without speaking as your persona. It sends your text as hidden story direction, like `/guided make Alex interrupt` or `/guided move the scene toward the market`.

For swipes and regens, enable **Settings -> Advanced -> Guide swipes/regens with chat input**. Then the current chat-box draft is used as guidance when you click **Regenerate**, create a new swipe/reroll, or manually trigger a character response in a group chat.

Guided `/guided` requests and guided manual character replies use Chat reply lorebook triggers. If an older lorebook entry was attached to Continue or Autonomous only so it could steer guided replies, move that entry to Chat reply.

If you want to post your persona message first without triggering a reply, enable **Settings -> Advanced -> Quick replies menu** and include **Post only**. The same settings submenu can include **Guide reply** for a quick `/guided` send and **Impersonate** for generating as your persona.

<a id="what-happens-if-i-enable-an-agent-and-also-have-similar-instructions-in-my-preset"></a>
<a id="what-happens-if-i-add-an-agent-and-also-have-similar-instructions-in-my-preset"></a>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if I add an agent to a chat and also have similar instructions in my preset?</strong></summary>
<br>

Both contribute to the prompt, but in different ways: a preset section is static text concatenated every turn, while an agent runs at request time and produces its own output. If both target the same behavior, the model receives both — usually redundant, occasionally conflicting, and always extra tokens.

Common overlaps to watch for:

- Writing-style or anti-repetition directives in the preset and the **Prose Guardian** agent.
- Plot-steering, twist, pacing, or "what should happen next" directives in the preset and the **Narrative Director** agent, including its Secret Plot option.
- "Track time / weather / location" instructions and the **World State** agent.
- "Track character mood / outfit / stats" instructions and the **Character Tracker** agent.
- Quest-tracking, combat-mechanics, or persona-stat instructions and their respective agents.
- HTML/CSS visual-styling prompts and the **Immersive HTML** agent.
- "Summarize past events" instructions and the manual or automated summary tools.

**The general rule:** pick one place to express each behavior. If you've added an agent that covers a behavior, you can usually remove the matching preset directive. If you'd rather keep your preset version (e.g., it's tuned for a particular character), remove the corresponding agent from that chat or turn off the related chat-level option.

For story direction, choose the tool by how persistent you want the guidance to be. Use **Narrative Director** for occasional next-beat steering. Turn on its **Secret Plot** option when you want hidden long-term arc memory and scene directions across turns. Use a preset only when the instruction should be static every turn.

**One important exception:** the `agent_data` marker section, and the `{{agent::TYPE}}` macro, are the _intended_ way to thread an agent's output into a specific spot in the preset. That's wiring, not overlap — several agents (World State, Quest Tracker, Character Tracker, and others) set this up for you by default. The pattern to avoid is hand-writing preset sections that duplicate an agent's _behavior_, not using the marker section that carries the agent's _output_.

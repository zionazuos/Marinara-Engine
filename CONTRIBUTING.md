# Contributing to Marinara Engine

This is the canonical contributor guide for Marinara Engine. Use it with `README.md` for the product overview, `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes, and `CLAUDE.md` only as a thin companion for maintainers using AI agent. All participants are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development Setup

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 24 LTS+
- Git
- pnpm via the repo-pinned `packageManager` if you are not using the launchers

Typical local setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine.git
cd Marinara-Engine
git checkout staging
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

> Active development happens on `staging`, not `main`. See [Branches](#branches) below before opening a PR.

Useful entry points:

- `pnpm dev` starts the server and client with hot reload.
- `pnpm dev:server` starts only the API server.
- `pnpm dev:client` starts only the Vite frontend.
- `start.bat`, `start.sh`, and `start-termux.sh` run the launcher flow, including git-based auto-update and optional browser auto-open.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when you need to change ports, HTTPS settings, or launcher behavior such as `AUTO_OPEN_BROWSER=false`.

## Branches

Marinara Engine uses two long-lived branches:

| Branch    | Role                                                                                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `staging` | Active development. All feature branches, bug fixes, and documentation PRs should target this. |
| `main`    | Release branch. Updated by maintainers as part of the release flow; do not target it directly. |

Guidelines:

- **Base your feature branch on `staging`**, not `main`. Run `git checkout staging && git pull` before branching.
- **Open PRs against `staging`**. The GitHub web UI defaults to `main` (the repo's default branch); change the base to `staging` when filing the PR.
- Do not target `main` directly unless a maintainer explicitly asks for a mainline-only change (e.g. release hotfix).
- Update checks and installation guides continue to track `main`, since end users install from released versions.

## Repo Layout

- `packages/client/` — React frontend, PWA shell, and UI components
- `packages/server/` — Fastify API, file-backed storage bridge, importers, and AI agents
- `packages/shared/` — Shared types, schemas, constants, and `APP_VERSION`
- `android/` — Android WebView wrapper for the Termux-served local app
- `win/` — Windows installer sources and helper scripts
- `docs/` — Docs and repo media assets
- `start.bat`, `start.sh`, `start-termux.sh` — platform launchers

## Validation

Baseline validation:

```bash
pnpm check
```

This runs the Impeccable project-context guard, workspace lint/type checks, and the production build.

Useful follow-up checks:

```bash
pnpm version:check
pnpm regression:prompt
pnpm smoke:ui
```

Regression guards:

- `pnpm regression:prompt` runs fast deterministic checks for prompt assembly, lorebook keyword matching, macros, summaries, and mode-specific generation gates.
- `pnpm smoke:ui` runs the Playwright browser smoke suite against isolated temporary app data.
- `pnpm regression` runs both lanes.

These checks are intentionally small and do not replace manual verification. When you change behavior, include the manual verification you performed and add or update a regression guard for the bug class when practical.

## Logging

All server-side logging goes through a shared [Pino](https://getpino.io/) logger instance exported from `packages/server/src/lib/logger.ts`. The `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable controls the minimum severity that gets printed (default: `warn`). See `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` for user-facing level descriptions.

### Level guidelines

| Level            | When to use                                         | Examples                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `logger.error()` | Unrecoverable failures that need investigation.     | Database errors, fatal agent failures, image generation crashes, command exceptions.             |
| `logger.warn()`  | Something went wrong but the request can continue.  | Non-critical agent failures, empty model responses, missing connections, non-fatal catch blocks. |
| `logger.info()`  | Operational milestones — "this happened".           | Seed results, game session lifecycle, commands executed, abort requests, device connections.     |
| `logger.debug()` | Verbose detail only useful when actively debugging. | Full prompts/responses, token usage, timing traces, state patches, pipeline internals.           |

### Code practices

- **Never use `console.log/warn/error` in server code.** Always import and use the shared logger:

  ```ts
  import { logger } from "../lib/logger.js"; // adjust relative path
  ```

- **Pick the right level.** If you aren't sure, ask: "Would an operator running in production want to see this?" If yes → `info`. If only a developer debugging → `debug`.

- **Use Pino format specifiers** for multi-argument calls. Pino does not auto-format extra positional arguments the way `console.log` does:

  ```ts
  // ✗ Wrong — second argument silently ignored by Pino
  logger.info("Resolved agents:", agents.length);

  // ✓ Correct — use %d / %s / %j format specifiers
  logger.info("Resolved %d agents", agents.length);

  // ✓ Also correct — template literals produce a single string
  logger.info(`Resolved ${agents.length} agents`);
  ```

- **Log errors with the error object first** (Pino convention for structured output):

  ```ts
  // ✗ Avoid
  logger.error("Import failed:", err);

  // ✓ Prefer — Pino serialises the error with stack trace
  logger.error(err, "Import failed");
  ```

- **Client-side code (`packages/client/`) should keep using `console.*`** — the browser has no Pino. Production builds automatically strip `console.log` via the Vite esbuild `pure` option; only `console.warn` and `console.error` survive.

- **Route handlers** that already have access to `app.log` or `req.log` may use those instead of the shared logger — they are child loggers of the same Pino instance and inherit the same level.

## Before You Open a Pull Request

1. **Open an issue first.** Before writing code, open an issue or check [the tracker](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine/issues) so we can agree on direction, scope, and whether someone else is already on it.

2. **Test it yourself.** A green `pnpm check` is the minimum. Also build the app and container, click through your change, and try the obvious edge cases (light/dark mode, mobile, empty states, error paths). If you touched UI, include before/after screenshots. Upload or attach temporary PR proof screenshots to GitHub or a gist; do not commit them under `docs/pr-evidence/`. Keep committed images for intentional docs/reference assets such as README screenshots. CodeRabbit won't catch "the button is invisible in light mode" — only you can.

3. **Don't trust AI-checked boxes.** If an AI agent ticked the test-plan checkboxes, treat them as your to-do list, not proof of testing. Verify each item in a real browser before submitting; untick anything you haven't personally confirmed.

4. **Smaller and working beats big and broken.** We'd rather review a tight PR that works on the first try than a large one that needs multiple rounds of fixes.

## AI Agent Workflow

AI coding agents should use `.github/agents/chai-workflow.md` as an additive workflow overlay. It adapts the Chai Agent Workflow Pack for Marinara's branch, issue, PR, validation, and risky-work expectations.

The overlay is not a substitute for this guide. When instructions conflict, follow this file, `AGENTS.md`, package-specific instructions, and maintainer requests first. The overlay is mainly a proof and coordination layer: reproduce before fixing when practical, verify the user-facing claim before saying done, keep PR/issue text exact, leave PR checkboxes unchecked for humans, and call out risky-work proof gaps honestly.

## Pull Request Expectations

- Target the `staging` branch. The GitHub UI defaults to `main`; change the base before submitting. See [Branches](#branches).
- Link the issue or feature request your PR addresses. If there isn't one yet, open one first (see [Before You Open a Pull Request](#before-you-open-a-pull-request)).
- Keep PRs focused. Separate unrelated refactors from user-facing fixes or documentation work.
- Explain the why clearly in the PR description. Reviewers should understand the user problem, regression, or tradeoff being addressed, not just the implementation summary.
- Update documentation in the same PR when behavior changes affect installation, updates, release flow, launchers, or platform-specific behavior.
- Include screenshots or short recordings for UI changes.
- Call out manual validation clearly, especially for launcher, installer, or Android wrapper changes.
- Avoid version drift. If your PR intentionally bumps a release, update every version-bearing file in one pass.

## Documentation Rules

- `README.md` is the user-facing overview and quickstart, not the full release log.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is the durable release-notes source and should be reusable for GitHub Releases.
- `android/README.md` is scoped to the Android wrapper around the Termux-served app.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the canonical contributor and maintainer workflow document.
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` is the environment variable and `.env` reference.
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` collects common user-facing issues and fixes.
- `docs/FAQ.md` is the user-facing FAQ for common questions like LAN access.
- If a change makes any existing doc misleading, fix that doc in the same PR.

## Versioning and Releases

Current policy:

- Canonical version source: root `package.json`
- Release tag format: `vX.Y.Z`
- Changelog authority: `CHANGELOG.md`
- Every other version-bearing file is derived and must be synchronized before tagging or publishing

Current version touchpoints:

| File                                        | Role                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `package.json`                              | Canonical application version                          |
| `packages/client/package.json`              | Derived workspace version                              |
| `packages/server/package.json`              | Derived workspace version                              |
| `packages/shared/package.json`              | Derived workspace version                              |
| `packages/shared/src/constants/defaults.ts` | Shared `APP_VERSION` used by the app and update checks |
| `win/installer/installer.nsi`               | Windows installer output version                       |
| `win/installer/install.bat`                 | Windows installer banner text                          |
| `android/app/build.gradle`                  | Android `versionName` and `versionCode`                |

Android policy:

- `versionName` must match the app version.
- `versionCode` must increase monotonically for every shipped APK.

Release-related behavior already in the repo:

- Docker publishing is triggered by `v*` tags.
- Tagged releases are published from `CHANGELOG.md` by the GitHub release workflow, with a temporary Android APK notice prepended so release-page downloaders know the APK still requires Termux.
- The server update check reads the newest GitHub `v*` tag and uses matching release metadata when it exists.
- Git-based installs can apply updates automatically; Docker installs are prompted with the pull command instead.
- Pull request CI runs `pnpm check`, `pnpm version:check`, and the tracked-installer guard.
- Built installer binaries belong on GitHub Releases and should not be committed back into the repository.

Standard release flow:

1. Bump the canonical version in root `package.json`.
2. Run `pnpm version:sync -- --android-version-code <next-code>` to sync all derived version fields.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Merge the release-ready `staging` change to `main`.
5. Create and push the tag `vX.Y.Z` from the `main` commit that contains that exact version bump.
6. Let the release workflows publish or update the GitHub Release, Windows installer, Android WebView shell APK, and GHCR container images (`X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `X`, `latest`, plus `X.Y.Z-lite` / `lite`) from the matching changelog entry.

Release helpers now in the repo:

- `pnpm version:sync -- --android-version-code <next-code>` updates the derived version files and README release references from the root `package.json` version.
- `pnpm version:check` fails when those derived files drift out of sync.
- `pnpm guard:installer-artifacts` fails when tracked installer binaries appear under `win/installer/*.exe`.
- `pnpm release:notes -- <version>` renders the matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry for release publication and prepends the temporary Android APK / Termux notice.

## Immediate Way Forward

- Add launcher and installer smoke tests so startup parity is exercised automatically, not just by manual verification.
- Consider a release wrapper script that bumps the root version, prompts for `versionCode`, runs `pnpm version:sync`, and opens the changelog entry for editing.

    id: "game-mode-model",

    question: "What model should I use for Game Mode?",

    bullets: [
      "Use a strong model for setup and major GM turns: Claude Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.x, or a similarly strong frontier model.",
      "Gemma 4 31B also holds up surprisingly well if you want a local option.",

    category: "Top Issue",
    question: "My trackers, Lorebook Keeper, or agents do nothing or fail with a max length error. What fixes that?",
    answer:
      "The most common fix is increasing max response length so the model can finish the tracker JSON instead of truncating it.",
    bullets: [
      "Raise max response length in your connection or chat Advanced Settings.",
      "If an agent keeps breaking formatting, move it to a stronger model, especially Gemma 4 or another reliable structured-output model.",

    id: "sidecar-cpu-fallback",
    category: "Top Issue",
    question: "I saw '[sidecar] Startup with max GPU offload failed, retrying with CPU fallback'. Is that normal?",
    answer:
      "Usually yes. Marinara's local sidecar is meant to live on CPU and RAM so your main RP model can keep the GPU and VRAM.",
    bullets: [
      "A fallback message does not automatically mean anything is broken.",
      "The sidecar is there for helpers and utility tasks, not to compete with your main model for VRAM.",

      "Add the Marinara folder to your antivirus exclusions before reinstalling or restoring files.",
      "Bitdefender and Windows Defender are the most common sources of quarantines here.",

      "Try localhost:7860 instead of 127.0.0.1, or the reverse if you already used localhost.",
      "Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R and clear the site's local storage.",

    question: "How do I update without the installer?",
    answer: "The updater expects a real Git checkout.",

    question: "Is the Android APK standalone?",
    answer: "No. The APK is only a WebView shell for Marinara Engine running locally in Termux.",
    bullets: [
      "Install Termux from F-Droid and run Marinara with ./start-termux.sh first.",
      "The APK opens the same-device local server at 127.0.0.1, so it cannot work if Termux is closed.",

    question: "'pnpm: not found' or install.bat failed. What now?",
    answer: "Your system usually just does not have pnpm available yet.",
    bullets: [
      "Install pnpm globally with npm install -g pnpm, or use the EXE installer if you want the guided path.",
      "On Android or Termux, a long pause at Corepack alignment is a recurring pain point rather than a special Marinara-only error.",
      "If Termux hangs specifically on 'Aligning pnpm via Corepack', let it finish before assuming it is dead.",

  {
    id: "google-cloud-credit",

    question: "Can I use Google Cloud's free credit with Marinara?",

    answer: "Gemma 4 is still the safest recommendation for most local users.",
    bullets: [
      "If you can fit it, go for dense 31B. Otherwise the MoE 26B A3B tier is the next best bet.",
      "Q4 and better quants are usually the sweet spot.",
      "Very small E2B or E4B class models are fine for helpers and sidecars, but not ideal for serious RP.",

  },
  {
    id: "bigger-agent-model",
    category: "Connections",
    question: "How do I use a bigger model for agents instead of the local sidecar?",
    answer:
      "Create a normal connection to your own Kobold, llama.cpp, or compatible endpoint and mark it for agent use.",
    bullets: [
      "The switch lives on the connection itself.",
      "Once enabled, agents can use that remote model instead of the local sidecar path.",
    ],

    id: "reverse-proxy",
    category: "Connections",
    question: "How do I use Claude Code or a reverse proxy?",
    answer: "There is no separate reverse-proxy field like SillyTavern uses.",
    bullets: [
      "Point a Custom or Anthropic-style connection directly at your local proxy URL, usually something like http://localhost:PORT/v1.",
      "If your proxy relies on account-based OAuth flows, expect them to be less stable than API-key setups.",

  },
  {
    id: "nanogpt-401",
    category: "Connections",
    question: "NanoGPT is throwing 401 errors. Why does recreating the connection help?",
    answer: "That has been one of the more reliable fixes for NanoGPT-specific auth weirdness.",
    bullets: [
      "Delete the broken connection and recreate it from scratch instead of endlessly editing the existing one.",
      "Some users only got rid of the 401 loop after remaking even the default NanoGPT connection.",

    id: "sampler-settings",

    question: "Where do I change temperature, top-p, and other sampler settings?",

      "That is where you adjust temperature, top-p, max response length, and similar generation settings.",

    id: "enable-agents",
    category: "Core",
    question: "How do I enable agents?",
    answer: "The answer depends on the mode.",
    bullets: [
      "In Roleplay mode, open Chat Settings and go to the Agents section for that chat.",
      "In Game Mode, most agents run in the background automatically. The user-facing toggles are mainly for scene analysis and image generation.",

  },
  {
    id: "same-character-chats",
    category: "Core",
    question: "How do I switch between different chats with the same character?",
    answer: "Use Recent Chats from the home screen or the branch-aware chat browser inside the app.",
    bullets: [
      "Chats with the same character are organized as branches rather than one giant flat thread.",
      "The branch selector at the top of the chat bar is the quickest in-chat way to jump between them now.",

    question: "Where are my chats, presets, and other data stored?",
    answer: "The main local database lives in packages/server/data/marinara-engine.db.",
    bullets: [
      "That is the file power users usually back up or inspect when they want direct access.",
      "Most of the 'where is X stored' questions end up there.",

    id: "sillytavern-import",
    category: "Core",
    question: "How does SillyTavern import behave?",
    answer: "Most data imports cleanly, but there are a few recurring gotchas.",
    bullets: [
      "Regex scripts still need to be imported separately.",
      "Character chats can sometimes end up merged under one unused-style branch during messy imports.",
      "Editing older imported multi-line character messages can still feel quirky, so treat that path carefully.",

  },
  {
    id: "prose-guardian-user-voice",
    category: "Agents",
    question: "Prose Guardian is impersonating me or writing the whole reply. Is that normal?",
    answer: "No. That is usually a weak agent-model problem, not what the agent is supposed to do.",
    bullets: [
      "Move your agents to a stronger model such as Gemma 4 if possible.",
      "If the bad behavior seems cached into the thread, copy the last user message, delete it and everything after it, then resend.",
    ],

    id: "attribute-scale",
    category: "Agents",
    question: "What counts as high or low for attribute stats?",
    answer:
      "The default expectation is basically DnD-style 1 to 20, but the model still interprets the fiction around it.",
    bullets: ["Think of 10-ish as ordinary and 18 to 20 as exceptional unless your setup says otherwise."],

    id: "narrative-director-captures-messages",
    category: "Agents",
    question: "Narrative Director is capturing my messages and bot replies inside itself. Why?",
    answer: "That has shown up most often with weaker or unstable model choices, especially GLM 5.1 style runs.",
    bullets: ["Switch the agent to a stronger model before rewriting prompts."],
  },
  {
    id: "comfyui-illustrator-setup",
    category: "Images",
    question: "How do I get ComfyUI or Illustrator working?",
    answer: "The workflow template has to expose the placeholders Marinara expects.",
    bullets: [
      "Use %prompt%, %width%, %height%, %negative_prompt%, and %seed% in the workflow or request template.",
      "Use %reference_image_01% through %reference_image_04% or %reference_image_name_01% through %reference_image_name_04% for multiple ComfyUI reference slots.",
      'If your JSON parser complains, wrap width and height placeholders in quotes, like "%width%".',

  {
    id: "image-resolution",
    category: "Images",
    question: "How do I change image resolution?",
    answer: "Set it on the image-generation connection itself.",

  },
  {
    id: "temp-must-be-1",
    category: "Images",
    question: "I got a 'Temp must be 1' error while using Illustrate. Which temperature is wrong?",
    answer: "Usually the image connection, not your main chat model.",
    bullets: ["Check the image-generation connection's temperature field first."],
  },
  {
    id: "booru-prompts",
    category: "Images",
    question: "How do I get booru-style prompts from Illustrator?",
    answer: "Edit the Illustrator agent prompt in the Agents section.",
    bullets: ["That is where you steer the prompt format rather than fighting the image connection settings."],
  },
  {
    id: "character-sprites",
    category: "Images",
    question: "How do I generate character sprites?",
    answer: "Open the character card and use the sprite generation flow from there.",
    bullets: ["You still need a working image-generation connection before the button becomes useful."],
  },
  {
    id: "game-invalid-json",
    category: "Game Mode",
    question: "Game Mode first generation failed with invalid JSON. How do I stabilize it?",
    answer: "Start by upgrading the model before changing anything else.",
    bullets: [
      "A strong GM model is the main fix here.",

  {
    id: "game-editability",
    category: "Game Mode",
    question: "Can I edit widgets, scenes, or journal-like Game Mode data after the fact?",
    answer: "Some of that is editable now, but not every auto-tracked piece is equally exposed yet.",
    bullets: [
      "Inventory, readables, and more session-level continuity details are much more editable than they used to be.",
      "Some auto-tracked journal sections are still more rigid than users expect.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "game-party-members",
    category: "Game Mode",
    question: "Can I add new party members mid-game?",
    answer: "Yes. Marinara can recruit party members during an active game now.",
    bullets: [
      "If some portraits or tracker details lag behind after recruiting someone new, refresh or regenerate the related asset rather than assuming the recruit failed.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "game-background",
    category: "Game Mode",
    question: "How do I change the Game Mode background?",
    answer: "The quickest path is usually to talk to the GM directly or rerun the scene or image pass for that beat.",
    bullets: [
      "Game backgrounds are tied to scene analysis and asset generation, so background changes often follow that pipeline rather than a single permanent toggle.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "talk-to-gm",
    category: "Game Mode",
    question: "Can I talk to the GM directly instead of playing in-character?",
    answer: "Yes. Switch into GM chat mode when you need direct out-of-scene help.",
    bullets: [
      "That is the easiest way to ask for lorebook updates, map changes, UI adjustments, or scene-management help without pretending it is an in-world action.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "session-summary",
    category: "Game Mode",
    question: "Does ending a session summarize it and let me continue later?",
    answer: "Yes. Ending a session generates continuity data and the next session can resume from that state later.",
    bullets: ["The session-end flow is meant to preserve a usable recap, not just close the chat."],
  },
  {
    id: "content-filtering",
    category: "Misc",
    question: "Is there built-in content filtering?",
    answer:
      "Not as a separate Marinara safety layer. Filtering behavior mostly depends on the model or provider you connect.",
  },
  {
    id: "shared-gpu",
    category: "Misc",
    question: "Can I run RP and image generation on the same GPU?",
    answer: "Sometimes, but VRAM is the hard limit.",
    bullets: [
      "It is possible on tighter setups, but image generation plus a big RP model is one of the fastest ways to hit a wall.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "mobile-app",
    category: "Misc",
    question: "Is there a mobile app?",
    answer:
      "Not as a standalone app yet. You can install Marinara as a PWA from the browser on phones and tablets while the server runs on your computer, Docker host, or Termux device.",
  },
  {
    id: "tts-support",
    category: "Misc",
    question: "Does Marinara support TTS?",
    answer: "Yes. There is built-in support for OpenAI-compatible TTS providers now.",
    bullets: [
      "Set it up from the Connections area and the TTS settings card.",
      "If you expected older advice saying TTS was extension-only, that is out of date now.",

  },
  {
    id: "translations",
    category: "Misc",
    question: "Can I chat in languages other than English? What about the UI?",
    answer: "Chat content works in other languages, but the UI itself is still English-first.",
    bullets: ["Non-English chats are fine.", "UI translations are still limited, though contributions are welcome."],
  },
  {
    id: "bug-reports",
    category: "Misc",
    question: "Where should I report bugs or request features?",
    answer: "Use the dedicated bug and feedback channel in Discord rather than dropping reports into general chat.",
    bullets: [
      "The home screen already links you to the Discord server.",
      "Using the proper report channel makes it much easier for maintainers to tag and follow up on problems.",

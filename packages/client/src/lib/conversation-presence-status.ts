/**
 * Resolve a character's live conversation presence the same way the server's
 * status endpoint does — active manual override first, then the current schedule
 * block — so the chat-list sidebar and the in-chat overlay agree with the
 * presence pill instead of reading a generation-time snapshot.
 *
 * Returns `null` when there is no live signal (no active override and no
 * schedule in play), in which case the caller keeps the stored
 * `conversationCharacterStatuses` snapshot. This is the single gate both client
 * surfaces share, so they cannot drift on which metadata is allowed to drive
 * live status.
 *
 * The schedule gate deliberately mirrors the server's own contract — its status
 * endpoint reads schedules via `inheritFreshConversationSchedules`, which uses
 * them whenever `conversationSchedulesEnabled !== false`. Matching that exactly
 * keeps these surfaces consistent with the presence pill (a stricter client-only
 * rule would diverge from the pill for legacy/imported schedule-backed chats).
 *
 * When the chat has schedules switched off this returns "online" rather than
 * `null`, matching the server, which resolves no schedules for that chat and so
 * reports the no-schedule default. Falling through to the snapshot instead would
 * leak the character's global, schedule-derived status into a chat that opted
 * out — the schedule belongs to the character, but the opt-out is per chat.
 * Overrides are validated by `getActiveStatusOverride` (status enum + expiry),
 * so a malformed or expired override falls through to the snapshot.

    `  [Name] [action] [expression]: Description of physical action or reaction. — Narrates what the character physically does. Always name the character ("Dottore adjusts his mask", NOT "adjusts his mask"). NO asterisks. Also use for brief non-verbal beats.`,

    `- Use [action] for physical actions, combat moves, exploration actions, and quick non-verbal reactions. Never use asterisks (*) — write plain text.`,
    `- Use [thought] sparingly for revealing inner conflict or foreshadowing`,
    `- Use [whisper:Name] for private asides (comedic or dramatic)`,
    `- ALWAYS include the [expression] tag for every line — it drives the portrait expression, while standard full-body poses are selected automatically by the engine`,
    `- Not every character needs to speak every turn — only those who would naturally react`,
    `- In [action] lines, ALWAYS address the player as "you" when describing something done to/around the player (e.g. "He gestures vaguely at your entire being")`,
    `- Dialogue text in [main], [side], and [whisper] should be in quotes`,
    `- NEVER generate dialogue lines for the player (${ctx.playerName}). You control only party members, not the player.`,
